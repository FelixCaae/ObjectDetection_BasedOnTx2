# Object Detection Research Based on TX2
Object Detection is a category of Computer Science which aims at recognizing objects in images and simultaneously report object`s position and bounding box.
Here is an example.
And another example.
(These can be found in yolo_github)
Current Object Detection technique can be subdivided into two  classes: one-stage methods and two-stage methods.Usually speaking, one-stage methods run faster and their models are simpler.Classic one-stage model includes yolo,ssd,retina-net and so on.These models and their variation are considered to be good for embeded system like TX2.

TX2 ,whose whole whole name is Nvidia Jetson TX2 , is a powerful embedded system. And this research is targerted at finding a good model for TX2 and tune it to make it even better.
